                <h4 class="mb-3" style="color:#0f7099; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight:900;">Paid Campaign Analysis & Implementation</h4>
                <p>With an established Google Ads account, we will analyze historical data to find what performs most favorably and tailor other parts to act similarly. We will then change bidding options, keywords, ad text, and destination links to align with our goals. The goal is to drive as many leads and sales as possible per dollar spent.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-3" style="color:#0f7099; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight:900;">Conversion Tracking & ROI Analysis</h4>
                <p>Our reports show which keywords are creating leads or sales and which are not. We monitor this to be sure we are focusing on the keywords that are working best and targeting specific phrases.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-3" style="color:#0f7099; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight:900;">Search Network Advertising</h4>
                <p>We monitor your search network advertising progress and engagement to adjust bids, ads, and keywords to reflect best the traffic that will engage most positively on your site.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-3" style="color:#0f7099; font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif; font-weight:900;">Ad Variation & Testing</h4>
                <p>Multiple ads are tested using A/B testing methods to determine which ads lead to the highest click-through and conversion rates. We will also develop landing pages, copy variations, and test which works best.</p>

              <p class="fs-6">All aspects of the account will be reviewed each month to determine what areas can be improved and ensure the campaign is running smoothly. Negative keywords and changes to your keywords will continuously improve results.</p>
              <p class="fs-6">Our end goal is to create a campaign with a high ROI (return on investment) that allows your company to spend wisely and grow profitable month after month. The manual process of reviewing your account ensures you’re not spending too much, and your ads are always shown in the optimal positions to convert. Throughout our process, we’ll discover the key for your website to be successful via PPC and grow the campaign as profitability rises. We work hand-in-hand with you and have conference calls each month to ensure we’re on the same page with goals & results.</p>

              <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3" style="color: #4d4d4d;">How Does Google Ads Work?</h2>
              <p class="text-dark">Google is the #1 search engine people go to when looking to seek information or solve problems, so being present precisely when they are looking for your product or service is crucial. Google Ads gives you a chance to choose which searches/keywords your ads appear for, what message you deliver to your potential customers, and which pages they visit when they first land on your website.</p>
              <p class="text-dark">We leverage the power of Google Ads to reach your customers at the right time, as we send them to the content on your site most likely to answer their questions or solve their problems. Using the various tools and tactics within Google Ads, we can attract visitors who are unfamiliar with your brand, remind past site visitors of what you have to offer, and help grow your business by increasing your sales or leads.</p>

              <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4" style="color: #4d4d4d;">How Much Do Google Ads Cost?</h2>
              <p class="text-dark">Google Ads are based on a cost-per-click model, meaning you pay each time someone clicks on one of your ads and visits your website. Each keyword has a different cost-per-click depending on how popular that keyword is and what other websites are willing to spend. Google Ads runs off of a bidding model, meaning if you’re willing to pay more than someone else, your ad will generally be above theirs. Because of this, the keywords that are most popular or work best for businesses to drive sales and leads, are usually the most expensive per click.</p>
              <p class="text-dark">One of the main benefits of Google Ads is that what you spend is completely up to you. If you are held to a strict marketing budget, we can work with you to decide which campaigns to prioritize so that we can maximize your return on investment. We will work with you to decide the optimal budget, based on your goals and competitive landscape, but the budget we ultimately agree on can be (and should be) increased or decreased depending on how the campaign is performing, seasonal changes in demand, or a variety of other factors. Regardless, you will always be aware of what you are spending, and you’ll always have complete control over the budget.</p>

              <p class="text-dark">From day #1 of our engagement together, our entire process is structured around one thing: helping you hit your business goals. Our sales team first learns what your goals are during the initial discovery phase, and if we both decide that a partnership would be valuable, we get right to work. You are assigned a dedicated Google Ads expert who will take your goals and craft an entire strategy around how we can effectively achieve those goals, aiming to hit those marks as soon as possible. Just like with any marketing campaign, we will need to fine-tune things over the first 2 or 3 months of the engagement to really start to see outstanding results, but our team never stops optimizing. We work tirelessly to ensure that your keywords, ad copy, budget, targeting, and all other facets of Google Ads are being analyzed, optimized, and enhanced with each month.</p>

              <h2 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4" style="color: #4d4d4d;">Google Ads Management for eCommerce Websites</h2>
              <p class="text-dark">We help eCommerce sites become visible at the exact time a potential customer is looking to purchase. Just like you have complete control over your advertising budget, you also have complete control over which searches trigger your ads to show. This is beneficial for eCommerce Google Ads clients because we can focus our efforts around keywords that show clear purchase intent. Although you would want to rank for searches like “new shoes” or “types of basketball shoes” for organic search results, your advertising dollars would be best spent on searches like “buy shoes online” since people searching for that phrase would be more likely to complete a purchase. We also help clients leverage the ads within Google Shopping, where they can see your product, learn about the item in more detail, and compare/contrast on why you are the better option than some of your competitors.</p>

              <p style="color: #636363; font-size:20px;">Poorly managed Google Ad campaigns are extremely common, meaning those businesses are spending more than needed to achieve their goals. Some of the main reasons for this include:</p>
              <ul style="color: #636363; font-size:20px;">
                <li>No one is actively managing the campaign</li>
                <li>Bidding on the wrong keywords</li>
                <li>Sending visitors to low converting landing pages</li>
                <li>Displaying Ads at the wrong time of day</li>
                <li>Only using text Ads and not Google Shopping</li>
                <li>A lack of negative keywords within campaigns</li>
                <li>Inexperience company managing the campaign</li>
                
              </ul>
              <p>Often we’re able to more than double leads or sales within a campaign without spending more money, meaning the campaign was only 50% effective. At Kaizen Digital, we’ll take you through a 75-point Google Ads audit that will show you the areas in which your campaign is not configured correctly and identify opportunities for improvement.</p>

              <p class="text-dark">A well-developed landing page that grabs the visitor’s attention and directs them to the next steps you want them to take is the key to a successful Ads campaign. Without a website and/or landing page that converts, you’ll never be able to position yourself for a positive return on ad spend. Some of the elements to consider include your imagery, headline, copy, and call to action (buttons and links for where you want them to go). We can help you to build great landing pages and also A/B test multiple versions of landing pages to see which perform best.</p>

              <p class="text-dark">Pricing for managing a Google Ads campaign can vary but typically range from 7-12% of spend. Meaning if you spend $10,000 a month on Ads, at 10% your management fee would be $1,000. In almost all cases we help the client to save more money than they spend on management fees by making the campaign highly efficient, effective, and profit-driven.

                  <div class="content">Google Ads is an advertising platform used to show your ads across Google and other Google properties, while AdSense is used as a way to monetize a website. For example, you would join the AdSense program if you wanted to place other brands’ ads on your site and earn revenue based on who sees or clicks on those ads. You would use Google Ads if you wanted customers or clients to discover your website, and subsequently buy one of your products or services.</div>

                  <div class="label">How Can I Advertise on YouTube?</div>
                  <div class="content">YouTube ads are managed directly through Google Ads. All you would need is a video to be uploaded to YouTube and we can help leverage that video in an advertising format, by showing on specific content, or by showing your video when people make searches directly within YouTube. YouTube is the 2nd most popular search engine, so leveraging an agency like Kaizen Digital who truly understands search marketing is crucial to ensuring your video ads will perform well.</div>

                  <div class="content">Negative keywords are used to instruct our Google Ads to not show up in certain circumstances. If your site sold musical keyboards, we would want to add “computer keyboard” or “Dell keyboard” as a negative keyword to ensure we only show up when customers are looking for musical instruments.</div>
